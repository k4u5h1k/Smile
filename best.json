What was that?!\"\n\nSo she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...\"You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.\"\n\nShe responded to my puzzled look by saying, \"Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?\"\n\nRealizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.\n\nThe very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.\n\nLet me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, \"That's fine, honey.\"\n\nShe appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, \"I think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.\"\n\nI could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, \"No honey, I don't feel like it.\"\n\nHer face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, \"WHAT?\"\n\nI then said \"Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.\n\nYou're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.\"\n\nAnd just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, \"Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?\"\n\nApparently, no sex tonight either!\n\n\n\nEdit: Didn't expect to make front page but glad lots of you got a laugh out of it!\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the gold!
